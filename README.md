# LAB1-DATA-STRUCTURES-AND-ALGORITHMS
LAB 1 
In this Lab you are required to create Vector container using C-style mechanisms
new/delete/pointers (without using STL).
You have to implement Vector with the following constraints:
1. You cannot modify Payload and User code, except when trying. The
submissions must include the original Payload and User code, so the
expected output can be verified.
2. You cannot use STL containers in your code. Do not use standard C++
header includes
